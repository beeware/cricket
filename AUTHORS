The PRIMARY AUTHORS are (and/or have been):

And here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made Cricket that much better:

    Stephen McDonald <steve@jupo.org>
    Simon Meers <simon@simonmeers.com>
    Thomas Sutton <me@thomas-sutton.id.au>
