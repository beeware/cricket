Cricket is part of the `BeeWare suite`_. The project website is `http://pybee.org/cricket`_.

Cricket is a graphical tool that helps you run your test suites.

Normal unittest test runners dump all output to the console, and provide very
little detail while the suite is running. As a result:

* You can't start looking at failures until the test suite has completed running,

* It isn't a very accessible format for identifying patterns in test failures,

* It can be hard (or cumbersome) to re-run any tests that have failed.

Why the name ``cricket``? `Test Cricket`_ is the most prestigious version of
the game of cricket. Games last for up to 5 days... just like running some
test suites. The usual approach for making cricket watchable is a generous
dose of beer; in programming, `Balmer Peak`_ limits come into effect, so
something else is required...

Quickstart
----------

At present, Cricket has support for:

* Pre-Django 1.6 project test suites,
* Django 1.6+ project test suites using unittest2-style discovery, and
* unittest project test suites.

In your Django project, install cricket, and then run it::

    $ pip install cricket
    $ cricket-django

``cricket-django`` will also work in Django's own tests directory -- i.e., you
can use ``cricket-django`` to run Django's own test suite (for Django 1.6 or
later).

In a unittest project, install cricket, and then run it::

    $ pip install cricket
    $ cricket-unittest

This will pop up a GUI window. Hit "Run all", and watch your test suite
execute. A progress bar is displayed in the bottom right hand corner of
the window, along with an estimate of time remaining.

While the suite is running, you can click on test names to see the output
of that test. If the test passed, it will be displayed in green; other test
results will be shown in other colors.

Problems under Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ubuntu's packaging of Python omits the ``idlelib`` library from it's base
package. If you're using Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 13.04, you can install
``idlelib`` by running::

    $ sudo apt-get install idle-python2.7

For other versions of Python and Ubuntu, you'll need to adjust this as
appropriate.

If you are getting an import error on Fedora while using Python 3 you should install
``python3-tkinter`` by running::

    $ sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

Problems under Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're running Cricket in a virtualenv under Windows, you'll need to set an
environment variable so that Cricket can find the TCL graphics library::

    $ set TCL_LIBRARY=c:\Python27\tcl\tcl8.5

You'll need to adjust the exact path to reflect your local Python install.
You may find it helpful to put this line in the ``activate.bat`` script
for your virtual environment so that it is automatically set whenever the
virtualenv is activated.
