Cricket
=======

Cricket a graphical tool that helps you run your test suites.

Normal unittest test runners dump all output to the console, and provide very
little detail while the suite is running. As a result:

 * You can't start looking at failures until the test suite has completed running,

 * It isn't a very accessible format for identifying patterns in test failures,

 * It can be hard (or cumbersome) to re-run any tests that have failed.

Why the name ``cricket``? `Test Cricket`_ is the most prestigious version of
the game of cricket. Games last for up to 5 days... just like running some
test suites. The usual approach for making cricket watchable is a generous
dose of beer; in programming, `Balmer Peak`_ limits come into effect, so
something else is required...

Quickstart
----------

At present, Cricket only has support for Django project test suites.

In your Django project, install cricket, and then run it::

    $ pip install cricket
    $ python -m cricket.django

This will pop up a GUI window. Hit "Run all", and watch your test suite
execute. A progress bar is displayed in the bottom right hand corner of
the window, along with an estimate of time remaining.

While the suite is running, you can click on test names to see the output
of that test. If the test passed, it will be displayed in green; other test
results will be shown in other colors.
